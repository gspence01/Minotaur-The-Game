# Minotaur the Game
## About
##### Inspiration:
>"Let the people of Athens this year draw lots for only six young men, instead of seven," said he, "I will myself be the seventh; and let the Minotaur devour me if he can!"

The classical Greek myth of the Minotaur centers around Theseus, son of Aegeus, a hero who sent himself down into the Minotaur's labrynth to save his people in Athens from an eternity of human sacrifices.

I love the idea of this classic and want to implament it in a game where the player navigates through a dark maze, aided by the hints left by a golden string trailing behind the character. 

##### Gameplay:
This game is the lovechild of PacMan and a classic RPG game. Similar to PacMan, the player will navigate a maze. However, they will also encounter different enemies hiding there, collect EXP/weapons to easily kill any enemy and make their way down each level until, finally, reaching the Minotaur.

##### Note:
For this specific class project, I'm just going to create one level and place the minotaur there. However, in the future, I hope to expand the game to have multiple weapons, maze difficulties, and enemies for the player to gain extra EXP.

## Assets
I plan on creating my own assets for Theseus, the Minotaur, and varying weapons with pixel art.
All images were created with the website [JSPaint](https://jspaint.app/).
I created all my gifs on [EZGif.com](https://ezgif.com/).

## Mechanics
The player will navigate with the arrow keys. Running into an object/weapon will allow the player to add it to inventory and use in future encounters with enemies.

If the player runs into an enemy, there will be a fight, where the player either wins or loses based on EXP and weapon possession.
