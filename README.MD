# Minotaur the Game
## About
##### Inspiration:
>"Let the people of Athens this year draw lots for only six young men, instead of seven," said he, "I will myself be the seventh; and let the Minotaur devour me if he can!"

The classical Greek myth of the Minotaur centers around Theseus, son of Aegeus, a hero who sent himself down into the Minotaur's labrynth to save his people in Athens from an eternity of human sacrifices.

I love the idea of this classic and want to implament it in a game where the player navigates through a dark maze, aided by the hints left by a golden string trailing behind the character. 

##### Gameplay:
This game will play a lot like PacMan. Similar to PacMan, the player will navigate a maze, encounter different enemies hiding there, collect EXP/weapons to easily kill any enemy and make their way down each level until, finally reaching the Minotaur.

## Assets
I plan on creating my own assets for Theseus, the Minotaur, and varying weapons with pixel art
